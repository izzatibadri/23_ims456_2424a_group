    <p> RM Handayani is the only restaurant with authentic Indonesian cuisine, boasting a history of more than 50 years. The dishes served are made from natural Indonesian ingredients. RM Handayani also provides a comfortable, natural, and warm ambiance, highlighting the distinctive characteristics of Indonesian culture. </p>
        
    <p>The roots of this restaurant were established by Mrs. Kasni in 1961. Initially known as "Depot Han," it was located in Taman Hiburan Rakyat, Jl Kusuma Bangsa, Surabaya. To manage this constantly bustling eatery, Mrs. Kasni received assistance from her son-in-law and daughter, Hanafie Surja and Inawatie.</p>
        
    <p>In the 1970s, Depot Han went through a transitional phase that eventually led to its transformation into one of the most popular restaurants in East Indonesia. Under the management of Hanafie Surja and Inawatie, the restaurant was renamed "Rumah Makan Handayani." As the number of customers grew in the 1980s, this restaurant moved to Jl Kertajaya. Ten years later, a new RM Handayani network was established. In the 1990s, RM Handayani opened a branch on Jl Jemursari. Then, in 2010, another branch opened in Sidoarjo, followed by additional ones in Paiton and Yogyakarta in 2013.</p>

    <p>The presence of the RM Handayani network expanded due to the increasingly positive response from customers. Several awards have also been bestowed upon them. Most recently, RM Handayani received the Surabaya Restaurant Award in the category of 'Top 5 Restaurants with Indonesian Cuisine'.</p>
